## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Materiality

- 3.92 Institutions should assess their Big Data Analytics and AI Applications to determine the
materiality and associated risks of each Application.

- 3.93 When conducting a materiality assessment of a Big Data Analytics and AI Application,
Institutions should consider:
  - a. The purpose of the Big Data Analytics and AI Application (i.e. use case) and its role in the
    Institution’s decision-making process;
  - b. The criticality and inherent risk profile of the activities (i.e. are they activities that are
    critical to the business continuity/viability of the Institution and its obligations to
    Customers); and
  - c. The likelihood that the activity may be disrupted and the impact of any such disruption.

### Governance

- 3.94 Institutions should establish an approved and documented governance framework for
effective decision-making and proper management and control of risks arising from the use of
Big Data Analytics and AI. The governance framework should:
  - a. Establish a mechanism to ensure that Institutions are required to assess whether the
    Application is suitable for Big Data Analytics and AI implementation and define specific
    parameters and criteria to enable the Institution in its decision-making;
  - b. Establish appropriate policies, procedures and controls to govern the design,
    development, monitoring, review and use of Big Data Analytics and AI Applications
    within the Institution;
  - c. Ensure proper validation of Big Data Analytics and AI Applications prior to their launch,
    and thereafter implement on-going training, calibration and review to ensure the
    reliability, fairness, accuracy and relevance of the algorithms, models and Data used and
    the results;
  - d. Maintain a transparent, enterprise-wide record of Big Data Analytics and AI Applications
    and their underlying mechanics;
  - e. Establish processes to assess, monitor, report and mitigate risks associated with the Big
    Data Analytics and AI Application;
  - f. Ensure that material decisions regarding Big Data Analytics and AI Applications and their
    underlying models and Data are documented and sufficiently justified; and
  - g. Cover every stage of the model lifecycle including design, development, deployment,
    review, update and discontinuation.

- 3.95 The Governing Body and Senior Management of the Institution should be accountable for the
outcomes and decisions arising from the use of Big Data Analytics and AI Applications, including
those Applications that make decisions on behalf of the Institution. They should:
  - a. Ensure that all Staff working on or using Big Data Analytics and AI Applications are
    assigned appropriate accountability for their involvement with Big Data Analytics and AI
    Applications and understand what they should to do meet this accountability; and
  - b. Ensure that technical specialists with appropriate technology skillsets (e.g. Big Data
    analysts, Artificial Intelligence engineers and specialists) and Application specific skillsets
    (e.g. credit risk modelling specialists if the Application is a credit scoring model) form
    part of the team actively involved in developing and implementing Big Data Analytics
    and AI Applications.

- 3.96 When Outsourcing to an Outsourcing Service Provider, Institutions should ensure that access to
information is adequately controlled, monitored, reviewed, and audited by the Institution’s
internal control functions, and regulators, or persons employed by them, including supervisory
reviews by the respective Supervisory Authority.

- 3.97 Big Data Analytics and AI Applications, including when the model is developed by an
Outsourcing Service Provider, should be auditable and, accordingly, Institutions, where relevant
and considering the type of application used, should maintain on-going and up-to-date
information through:
  - a. Establishing audit logs and maintaining traceability of decisions and outcomes of the Big
    Data Analytics and AI Application;
  - b. Developing and maintaining design documentation (further guidance provided in Clause
    Institutions should maintain documentation outlining the design of the material Big Data
    Analytics and AI model including but not limited to, where applicable:);
  - c. Maintaining records of the various versions of the model including its code (further
    guidance provided in Clause Institutions should establish a robust system for versioning
    and maintain record of each version of the material Big Data Analytics and AI model
    including but not limited to, where applicable:);
  - d. Archiving original Datasets used to develop, re-train or calibrate models;
  - e. Tracking outcomes and performance of the Big Data Analytics and AI Application; and
  - f. Retaining above information for a minimum period of five (5) years, or as otherwise
    prescribed by applicable laws and regulations.

### Design

- 3.98 Institutions should ensure that the models for their Big Data Analytics and AI Applications are
reliable, transparent, and explainable, commensurate with the materiality of those
Applications. Accordingly, Institutions, where appropriate, should consider:
  - a. Reliability: Implementing measures to ensure material Big Data Analytics and AI
    Applications are reliable and accurate, behave predictably, and operate within the
    boundaries of applicable rules and regulations, including any laws on data protection or
    cyber security;
  - b. Transparency: Institutions should be transparent in how they use Big Data Analytics and
    AI in their business processes, and (where reasonably appropriate) how the Big Data
    Analytics and AI Applications function; and
  - c. Technical Clarity: Implementing measures to ensure the technical processes and
    decisions of a Big Data Analytics and AI model can be easily interpreted and explained to
    avoid the threat of “black-box” models. The level of technical clarity should be
    appropriate and commensurate with the purpose and materiality of the Big Data
    Analytics and AI Application (e.g. where the model results have significant implications
    on decision making).

- 3.99 Institutions should adopt an effective Data governance framework to ensure that Data used by
the material Big Data Analytics and AI model is accurate, complete, consistent, secure, and
provided in a timely manner for the Big Data Analytics and AI Application to function as
designed. The framework should document the extent to which the Data meets the Institution’s
requirements for data quality, gaps in data quality that may exist and steps the Institution will
take, where possible, to resolve these gaps over time.

- 3.100 Institutions should make regular efforts to ensure data used to train the material Big Data
Analytics and AI model is representative (i.e. how relevant the Data and inferences drawn from
the Data are to the Big Data Analytics and AI Application) and produces predictable, reliable
outcomes that meet objectives.

- 3.101 Institutions should be able to promptly suspend material Big Data Analytics and AI Applications
upon the Institution’s discretion such as in the event of a high cyber threat, information security
breach or malfunctioning of the model.

- 3.102 Institutions should, where relevant, conduct rigorous, independent validation and testing of
material trained Big Data Analytics and AI models to ensure the accuracy, appropriateness, and
reliability of the models prior to deployment. Institutions should ensure the model is reviewed
to identify any unintuitive or false causal relationships. The validation may be carried out by an
independent function within the Institution or by an external organisation.

- 3.103 Institutions should maintain documentation outlining the design of the material Big Data
Analytics and AI model including but not limited to, where applicable:
  - a. The input Data source and Data description (types and use of Data);
  - b. The Data quality checks and Data transformations conducted;
  - c. Reasons and justifications for specific model design and development choices;
  - d. Methodology or numerical analyses and calculations conducted;
  - e. Results and expected outcomes;
  - f. Quantitative evaluation and testing metrics used to determine soundness of the model and its results;
  - g. Model usage and implementation;
  - h. Form and frequency of model validation, monitoring and review; and
  - i. Assumptions or limitations of the model with justifications.

- 3.104 Institutions should introduce controls to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the codes used
in the material Big Data Analytics and AI Application so that the code is only accessed and
altered by authorized persons.

- 3.105 Institutions should identify and monitor the unique risks arising from use of the material Big
Data Analytics and AI Application and establish appropriate controls to mitigate those risks.
